About the Project :

This is a project focused on creating a reference implementation of a Kubernetes Cluster with 10000 Pods (hundreds/thousands of nodes). Initially we begin with 10000 Pods , then do concurrent executions. Once we have 10000(10K) nodes we will be changing this project to be 100000 (100K) nodes.

Project Description :

Objective - Start very small in the order of creating few PODS - Establish How many nodes are needed, what other services are needed, schedule tasks and pull the performance statistics as to how much time it takes to create and delete a POD.
Post approval of getting this architected and implemented based on your confirmation we can spin and scale up to hit 10K Pod creation in parallel in progressively stage up manner. End result is to protect Sharepoint and the users can be any customer using Sharepoint.

Frequently answered questions:

1 Who are your Users?
All users of Sharepoint files
2. What are their high-level needs?
To securely access files in Sharepoint - To and Fro transfers
3.At a high-level, how do you meet these needs? (eg: what are your high-level capabilities?)
By providing secure access to files in Sharepoint
4. What sorts of products/services do you need?
Basically runs on a Kubernetes Architecture
5. Do you rely on the products/services from another Glasswall OS team?
Yes the ICAP Engine (to be integrated)
6. What management methods are you using?
Agile/Scrum

It's also important to note that our project has got nothing to do about Sharepoint but only with secure file accessing in Sharepoint.
